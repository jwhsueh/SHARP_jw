Dear Dr. Flower,

We would like to bring up a concern that has come up in the back and forth discussions with the referee.  While we definitely feel that the referee's comments have improved this paper, we are starting to become a bit concerned about the tone of the referee's responses.  The referee seems to be very dismissive of the possibility that a disc component with the mass that we have determined could be the cause of the flux ratio anomaly and, in particular, states that in other lens systems that show arcs, the disc mass makes up less than 1 per cent of the Einstein ring mass.  In our first response to the referee, we tried in good faith to address this point by citing papers from the SWELLS survey that contradict the referee's assertion.  The referee completely ignored or missed this point and restated his/her objection to the massive disc model.  The referee seems to be drawing his/her conclusions from a sample that has a different nature than our object (B1555+375).  While his/her statement may be true for massive elliptical lenses, we have pointed out (more explicitly this time) that the SWELLS sample shows that disc galaxies exhibit different behaviour.  

We hope that our work will receive an objective evaluation, and we certainly appreciate some the referee's comments so far.  However, we also feel that we are making a good faith effort to address the referee's points, and we're not quite sure how to proceed if the referee does not respond to the changes that we have made but instead makes blanket statements based on samples that are not appropriate for the object being studied in this paper.  Although this is not the course that we would prefer, we are strongly considering requesting a new referee if the next referee report continues in the style of the previous one.

Thank you for your consideration,

  Jen-Wei Hsueh (for the authors)
