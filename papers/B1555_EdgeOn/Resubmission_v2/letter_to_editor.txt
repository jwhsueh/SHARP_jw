Dear Dr. Flower,

We would like to bring up a concern that has come up in the back and forth discussions with the referee.  While we definitely feel that the referee's comments have improved this paper, we are starting to become a bit concerned about the tone of the referee's responses.

First, we have noticed that there appears to be a fundamental disagreement between the referee and us about the topic of this paper.  We realize that we may have been a bit overly enthusiastic in our initial interpretation and, particularly our title.  However, we still feel that the point of submitting this paper as a Letter is to provide a timely bit of information to the community about this potentially serious effect, especially as it impacts one of the small (fewer than 10 systems) sample of lens systems with robustly measured time delays.  The referee appears to want the much more th  Although we try to explain and ease this disagreement in the first referee response, we feel puzzled to see that the referee replied our results are not consistent with the title so they are unacceptable for publication. On the other hand, as the arXiv preprint has been released for more than a month, the feedback from the community is positive and we received no report on questioning the title or abstract.

Second, the statement made by the referee reputing our result in disc component mass is incorrect. We respect the referee’s expertise in this field and expect to receive a fair peer review. However, the referee cited the number from a group of systems having completely different nature than our object. This deepens our concern, saying that the referee may unintentionally have unobjective attitude toward this work.


Our hope is that our work receives an objective review and we appreciate the referee’s professional evaluation. With the concern we address above, a suggestion to change the referee may be one of our choices if the next report is still in the similar tone. At the meanwhile, we also made changes to the paper based on the referee’s comments and hope our efforts will solve these existing disagreements between the referee and us.
