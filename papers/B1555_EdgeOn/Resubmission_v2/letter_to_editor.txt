Dear Editor,

Please find attached our revised paper and response to the Refereeâ€™s comments.

While we definitely feel that the referee's comments have improved the content and presentation of our results, we are starting to become a bit concerned about the tone of the referee's responses.  The referee seems to be very dismissive of the possibility that a disc component with the mass that we have determined could be the cause of the flux ratio anomaly and, in particular, states that in other lens systems that show arcs, the disc mass makes up less than 1 per cent of the Einstein ring mass.  In our first response to the referee, we tried in good faith to address this point by citing papers from the SWELLS survey that contradict the referee's assertion.  The referee completely ignored or missed this point and restated his/her objection to the massive disc model.  We have re-phrased some of the text which will hopefully clear up this misunderstanding. The referee seems to be drawing his/her conclusions from a sample that has a different nature than our object (B1555+375).  While his/her statement may be true for massive elliptical lenses, we have pointed out (more explicitly this time) that the SWELLS sample shows that disc galaxies exhibit different behaviour.  

The referee is also quite dismissive of about the full content of the paper, suggesting that we change the title to something which does not reflect the analysis that includes both optical and infrared imaging, radio imaging and an updated lens model that takes all of the available observational information into account. We hope that our new title, which fully reflects the content and main conclusions of the paper is now considered acceptable.

We hope that our work will receive an objective evaluation, and we certainly appreciate some the referee's comments so far.  However, we also feel that we are making a good faith effort to address the referee's points, and we're not quite sure how to proceed if the referee does not respond to the changes that we have made but instead makes blanket statements based on samples that are not appropriate for the object being studied in this paper.

Thank you for your consideration,

  Jen-Wei Hsueh (for the authors)
