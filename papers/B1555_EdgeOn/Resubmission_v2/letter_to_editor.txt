Dear Dr. Flower,

We would like to bring up a concern that arose from the discussions with the referee via back and forth comments and responses. We think that referee's comments improve this paper. However, we also feel concerned that the referee's attitude toward this paper is unobjective, especially in the second referee report.

First, we noticed that the referee seems to have a fundamental disagreement on the topic of this work. Although we try to explain and ease this disagreement in the first referee response, we feel puzzled to see that the referee replied our results are not consistent with the title so they are unacceptable for publication. On the other hand, as the arXiv preprint has been released for more than a month, the feedback from the community is positive and we received no report on questioning the title or abstract.

Second, the statement made by the referee reputing our result in disc component mass is incorrect. We respect the referee’s expertise in this field and expect to receive a fair peer review. However, the referee cited the number from a group of systems having completely different nature than our object. This deepens our concern, saying that the referee may unintentionally have unobjective attitude toward this work.


We hope that our work receives an objective review and also appreciate the referee’s professional evaluation. With the concern we address above, a suggestion to change the referee may be one of our choices if the next report is still in the similar tone. At the meanwhile, we also made changes to the paper based on the referee’s comments and hope our efforts will solve these existing disagreements between the referee and us.
