We thank the referee for his/her comments about the paper.  We have
responded to the comments below, and modified the text accordingly.
Overall, we have toned down our somewhat sweeping claims.

RESPONSE: The referee is correct to point out that we did not quantify
the bulge/disk ratio in the lensing galaxy.  We have performed a
bulge+disk fit to the lens-galaxy surface brightness distribution.
Our fit returns a bulge component that is consistent with zero
emission.  We have added text to the paper describing this result.  We
note that the two components in our lens model can be thought of as
the edge-on disk and the dark-matter halo of the lensing galaxy.

RESPONSE: The referee is correct in pointing out that the modelling of
the extended images would provide tighter constraints on the proposed
model. As a matter of fact, we had hoped to do exactly the analysis
that the referee has suggested.  Unfortunately, in the case of B1555
IR imaging the SNR of the lensed extended emission is low.  More
importantly, the disk is responsible for a significant level of dust
extinction that leave images D and B unobservable, and even the arc
near image A strongly affected. We have, however, tried modelling this
dataset by only focusing on image C which is not affected by dust, and
the results are consistent with those found by modelling the point
images positions and fluxes. For the VLBI extended images the poor
quality of the data prevented us from modelling this dataset in a
reliable manner.  We have added text to the manuscript explaining
this.

RESPONSE: In the SHARP sample, we find that 5 out of the 25 systems
that we imaged have clear disk components, indicating that this is not
a completely unexpected phenomenon.  While we agree with the referee
that it is important to quantify how common disks are in lensing
galaxies, we do not feel that the SLACS sample provides the
appropriate comparison.  This is because a significant portion of the
SHARP systems come from source-selected samples, such as CLASS, that
are agnostic about the nature of the lensing galaxy.  In fact, CLASS
contains at least one other system, B1600+434, where the lensing
galaxy appears to be an edge-on disk with a very low bulge/disk ratio.
In contrast, SLACS lenses were selected to be systems where the
lensing galaxy was known a priori to be a massive elliptical galaxy.
We would therefore expect a lower incidence of disky systems in SLACS
than in the SHARP sample.  We agree completely with the referee that
doing a quantification of the statistics of massive disks and their
effects on flux-ratio anomalies is an extremely important task and, in
fact, this is one of the future projects that we are planning.
However, we feel that such an extensive analysis is beyond the scope
of this letter.  As such, we have modified the text to focus more on
this individual lens system and put more caveats on the possible
generalization of the results.
