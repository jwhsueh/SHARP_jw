\begin{abstract}

Gravitational lens flux-ratio anomalies provide a powerful technique
for detecting the presence of dark matter substructure in distant
galaxies.  However, before using the statistics of systems with these
anomalies, it is imperative to ascertain that a given system does not
have properties that could plausibly cause the observed anomaly
without the need for substructure.  In this letter, we present the
case of the B1555+375 lens system, which has a strong radio-wavelength
flux-ratio anomaly but where the lensing galaxy is also revealed in
high-resolution imaging to have a clear edge-on disk component.  The
disk crosses directly over the pair of images that exhibit the
anomaly, and we show that simple models that include the disk can
reproduce the anomaly without requiring substructure.  Several [??]
other lens systems that we have observed with adaptive optics imaging
as part of the Strong lensing at High Angular Resolution Programme (SHARP)
show similar behaviour.  These results suggest that the assumption that
all flux-ratio anomalies are due to substructure will likely overestimate
the substructure fraction in massive galaxies.

\section{Introduction}

A common feature of simulations of structure formation is the presence
of thousands of subhaloes that are associated with larger mass haloes.
However, observations of the Local Group find many fewer satellite
galaxies than are predicted by the simulations, even when taking into
account completeness corrections arising from the limited sky coverage
imposed by the Galactic Plane. [NEED REF]  This is the famous ``missing
satellite'' problem \citep{Klypin1999, Moore1999, S07}. In order to
understand this discrepancy, it is imperative to build up a large
sample of satellites/subhaloes in galaxies outside the Local Group.
This process is challenging due to the faintness of the satellite
galaxies.  Furthermore, lower-mass satellites may not be able to
retain the gas needed for ongoing star formation \citep[e.g.,][]{P11},
rendering them effectively dark.  These factors make gravitational
lensing a powerful and promising tool for the detection of
substructure.

It was first suggested by \citet{Mao1998} that flux ratio anomalies observed in radio loud multiple images of lensed quasar could be interpreted as the telltale of the presence of substructure in lens galaxies.
%Flux ratio anomalies are seen in strong lensing systems which have multiple images that are spacially close to each other. These ``merging doubles'' share the same surface brightness in principle but happend to have different surface brightness. 
Indeed, small perturbations in the gravitational potential are
sufficient to bring flux ratio anomalies in strong lensed systems \citep{Bradac02}. 
Moreover, unlike in the optical or infrared, in the radio band, lensed
images are not sensitive to micro lensing from stars nor dust
extinction.  This makes flux ratio anomalies a promising tool to
detect dark matter substructures \citep{Dalal2002, N13}.  At present,
the amount of substructure derived from flux ratio anomalies is in
disagreement with predictions from numerical simulations, with the
former requiring a larger fraction of mass in substructure than
expected \citet{Xu14}. While this could be the result of small sample
statistics, it could also be the indication that flux ratio anomalies
have a different origin than substructure. 
%
An alternative method for
the detection of substructure in gravitational lens galaxies based on
the surface brightness distribution of extended arcs and Einstein ring
has been introduced by \citet{K05} and \citet{V09}. Interestingly, the fraction of
substructure measured with this \emph{gravitational imaging technique}
is currently in agreement with theoretical expectations \citep{V14a}.

While future large-scale surveys, such as the LSST, are expected to
deliver new large samples of gravitationally lensed quasars, in the
near future the discovery of new systems using narrow-line quasar
emission \citep{N14} will provide new invaluable statistical
perspective on current constraints based on flux ratio anomalies.  In
this paper, we explore the idea that not all flux ratio anomalies are
related to the presence of substructure, but that some originate in a
more complex lens galaxy mass distribution than initially
considered. To this end we use new infra-red data from the Strong
lensing at High Angular Resolution Program (SHARP; Fassnacht et al.,
in prep). The main goal of the SHARP project is to re-observe known
quadruple and Einstein ring lens systems at a much higher angular
resolution by making use of observations with (1) adaptive optics (AO)
on the Keck telescopes, (2) the Hubble Space Telescope, and (3) large
interferometric arrays \citep{SHARP12,V12}. In particular, to better
understand the causes of flux ratio anomalies in gravitational lenses
we focus on the B1555+375 lens system\citep{Marlow}.  This system was
discovered in the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey \citep{CLASS1,CLASS2} and
has a pair of merging images that show a strong flux ratio anomaly at
radio wavelengths.  Follow-up observations ruled out radio propagation
effects as the cause of the anomaly \citep{K03,KD04}.  The B1555+375
system was included in both the observational and theoretical analysis
of \citet{Dalal2002} and \citet{Xu14} and, thus, understanding its
mass distribution is of key importantce.  Our analysis makes use of
the new information obtained from the latest SHARP infrared imaging.
The paper is organized as follows: the latest SHARP data are
introduced in section 2; in section 3 we present the lens model while
the results of this analysis and their implications are discussed in
section 4.

%However, only small number of flux ratio anomalous systems in \simona{the} radio are \simona{currently} avaliable. Besides waiting for future large-scale survey such as LSST to find thousands of more new lens galaxies, another approach \simona{is to} seek out more flux ratio anomalous systems \simona{using} narrow-line quasar emission \citep{N14}. 
%	With expected growth in the number of samples, several groups have developed the technique to estimate the properties of substructures from flux ratio anomalous systems. \citet{V09, H13} both analyze the strong lens imaging to detect substructures lie infront of Einstein ring. Their methods improve the detectable mass limit and also show that high spatial resolution imaging is essential for the substructure study. On the other hand, numerical simulations on structure formation do not reach the concise conclusion on flux ratio anomalous systems. The latest study on the cause of flux anomalies from \citet{Xu14} shows the low probability of the existence of substructures in their studied systems. 
%	The Strong lensing at High Angular Resolution Program(SHARP) is a project aims on known quadruple and Einstein ring lensing systems \citep{SHARP12}. We obtain high-resoltion images from Keck adaptive optics(AO) and Hubble Space Telescope(HST) observations. 
%To better understand the cause of flux ratio anomaly in strong lensing systems, we model B1555+375, one of the systems discussed in \citet{Xu14}, with the new information obtained from the latest SHARP infrared imaging. We present the latest SHARP data in part 2, lens model of B1555+375 in part 3, and discussion in part 4.

\subsection{Keck Adaptive Optics Imaging}

The B1555+375 system was observed using the NIRC2 camera on the Keck 2
Telescope on the night of 2012 May 16 UT.  The adaptive optics system
was used, with the corrections derived from the laser guide star and a
$R$=14.4 tip-tilt that was located 45$^{\prime\prime}$ from the lens
system.  The ``narrow camera'' mode was used, giving a field of view
of roughly 10$^{\prime\prime}$\ on a side and a pixel scale of 10~mas.
Six dithered 300~s exposures were obtained in $K^{\prime}$ band.  The
data were reduced with the standard SHARP pipeline, which is a
python-based package that is a refinement of the process described in
\citet{Auger_EELS1}.  A cutout of the final reduced image is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:multiband} and again in Fig.~\ref{fig:merlin} with
contours from the MERLIN radio observations of \citet{Marlow}
overlaid.  There are several notable features in the Keck AO data.
These include the nearly complete lack of emission associated with the
B and D lensed images, as can be seen by comparing the radio contours
to the $K^\prime$-band emission, and faint but clearly visible
emission from what appears to be an edge-on lensing galaxy.

\subsection{Hubble Space Telescope Archival Imaging}

The B1555+375 system was also observed by the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) in three broad bands.  The optical data were obtained with the
Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) in the F555W and F814W bands
(GO-8804; PI: E.\ Falco), while the Near Infrared Multi-Object
Spectrograph (NICMOS) was used to observe the system in the $F160W$
band (GO-9744; PI: C.\ Kochanek).  The NICMOS observations were
obtained with the NIC2 camera.  We reduced all of the archival HST
data with the standard {\tt multidrizzle} pipeline [?? CHECK WITH
  MATT], producing final drizzled images with pixel scales of 50~mas.
The reduced images are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:multiband}.  The lens
system is not detected at high significance in the optical bands, but
is clearly seen in the NICMOS $F160W$ image.  The edge-on lensing
galaxy stands out in the NICMOS image.

The observation details of Keck AO and HST imaging are shown in Table 1.

\section{Lens Modelling}

To model B1555+375, we use the lens modeling code {\tt glafic}
\citep{Oguri}.  The inputs to the model are the observed image
positions and flux densities measured by the radio observations of
\citet{Marlow}.  These authors present a singular isothermal ellipsoid
(SIE) model that provides the first fit to the image positions but
does not reproduce the strong flux ratio anomaly between components A
and B.  \citep[see Fig.~6 and Tables 2 \& 3 in][]{Marlow}.  Although
the flux ratio anomaly that is observed in the radio data may be
caused by substructure in the lensing galaxy, our high-resolution near
infrared imaging suggests another explanation.  In both the $K^\prime$
band adaptive optics data and the HST imaging (two rightmost panels in
Fig. 1), the lensing galaxy has a clear edge-on disk component with a
position angle of $\approx 10$ degree.  We therefore model the system
with a disk component in order to see if such a model can explain the
flux ratio anomaly without the need for substructure.  The edge-on
disk may also explain the system morphology that is observed in the
near infrared imaging.  In particular, neither image B nor image D is
detected in the Keck AO data (Fig.~\ref{fig:merlin}), and both of
these lensed images lie on or close to the edge-on disk.  Thus, strong
extinction in the disk could cause the lack of detection of these
images.

As a first trail of modelling, we create a single SIE model to 
justify the perforamnce of a simple lensing potential. Consistent with previous studies
\citep{Marlow, Xu14}, our single elliptical potential model cannot predict flux anomaly in B1555+375. 
We then create two separate models of the lensing potential.  In the
first we treat the lens as a SIE bulge and an exponential edge-on disk
(SIE+expdisk).  In the second model the disk is represented as a very
elongated SIE component (2-SIE).  The lens system is red, with a
strong jump in flux between the F814W (roughly I) and F160W (roughly
H) bands (Fig.~\ref{fig:multiband}), so we assign a lens redshift of
$z_\ell = 1.0$ and a source redshift of $z_s =1.5$. Our steps to explore the parameter space are: 1) Apply strong priors from SHARP AO image to the edge-on disk position angle and ellipticity, and use the best-fit model of \citet{marlow} as the start point of the bulge component and the source position. 2) Let all parameters without priors vary to reach a temporary best-fit. 3) Start with the best-fit in step 2 and let all parameters with priors vary to reach another best-fit (also ensure this best-fit is not far from the priors). 4) Let all parameters vary to reach the final optimal model. 
The full best-fit parameters are shown in Table
2. Both of these models predict fairly matched results with the radio
observation, and the 2-SIE model has a better performance in flux
ratios. The comparison of observation and our lens modelling is given
in Figure 3 and Tables 3 \& 4.

\section{Discussion}

Gravitational lensing is [one of] the most powerful methods for
studying substructure in galaxies outside of the Local Universe, and
the flux ratio anomaly systems are a key aspect of these
investigations.  However, before using the flux ratio anomaly in any
given system to investigate structure formation and the properties of
dark matter, it is critical to eliminate other possible explanations
for the difference between the observed and expected fluxes.  It is
for this reason that much of the effort in the flux-ratio technique
has been focused on radio-loud lens systems.  At these wavelengths,
dust extinction and microlensing effects should be minimal
\citep[although see][for a rare example of radio microlensing]{K2000}.
Radio propagation effects can affect radio fluxes, as is clearly shown
in the B0128+437 system \citep{B04}.  However, these propagation
effects can be disentangled from substructure lensing because they
have well known dependencies on wavelength. \citet{KD04} examine all
eight radio loud flux anomalous lenses besides B0128=437, namely: MG
0414+0534, B0712+472, B1359+154, B1422+231, B1555+375, B1608+656,
B1933+503, and B2045+265.  They find no strong wavelength dependence
in the flux ratios of all these systems and therefore rule out radio
propagation effects as significant contributors to the observed
anomalies.

In our models based on the new imaging from the SHARP $K^{\prime}$
band observations, the most significant difference in comparison to
previous modelling is a new edge-on disk component. With a bulge plus
an edge-on disk, our models produce matches to both the radio image
positions and the flux ratio, while models with only one SIE
component \citep{Marlow,Xu14} fail to reproduce the fluxes
correctly. Our successful modelling indicates that the
kiloparsec-scale structure of lens galaxy itself is sufficient to
explain the flux ratio anomalies in B1555+375, without any need to
invoke the presense of substructure.  

% This breaks the idea that in strongly lensed quasars, radio flux ratio
% anomalies are most likely originated from substructure
% perturbations. Our discovery shows a complex lens galaxy mass
% distribution can dominate flux ratio anomalous phenomena in a strongly
% lensed system.

From a theoretical perspective, \citet{Xu14} find that substructures
cannot explain the observed radio flux anomalies in all the lenses
that were considered. By adding subhaloes from numerical simulations
on to these systems, only one out of eight radio loud systems
reproduces the level of flux anomalies seen in the data.  The rest of
them are unlikely (only $1 \% - 4 \%$ probability) to have flux
anomalies produced by substructure, including our target B1555+375.
In fact, among those eight radio lenses, B1555+375 is one of the most
anomalous systems, but it is also one of the most challenging systems
to explain by substructures. \citet{Xu14} conclude the failure in
predicting flux ratios is due to oversimplified/improper lens
modelling. They also point out that the SIE component and the external
shear in their model are orthogonal, indicating a possible missing
ingredient in lens model. Their results are consistent with the SHARP
$K^{\prime}$ band observations, in which an edge-on disk crosses the
radio merging double. 

Additional near-infrared AO imaging from SHARP shows that B1555+375 is
not the only system having a significant disk component detection in
the lensing galaxy (see Fig 4).  These systems will be investigated in
future work, but the images alone strongly suggest that other lens
systems have similar links between flux-ratio anomalies and disk
components.  Although the number of radio loud flux anomalous lensed
quasars remains small, a new technique using narrow-line emission
regions will enlarge the sample and bring statistical perspective on
substructures in the near future \citep{N14}. It is well known (e.g,
Kochanek 199??) that lens models based only on the locations of lensed
quasar/AGN images have large degeneracies.  Therefore, before
concluding that the flux ratios in any given lens system are a result
of substructure, it is critical to explore a range of smooth models
that are informed by additional observations or to do a comprehensive
analysis such as that conducted by \citet{Xu14}.  Otherwise, derived
substructure fractions should be considered as upper limits.

% We would like to draw attention to the possible impacts on
% substructure searching from this enge-on disk orginated flux
% anomalies. It is a sign that researchers should be careful about the
% flux anomalies fraction in lensed quasars. It may be worth considering
% an upper limit of flux anomalies fraciton from observation results to
% avoid over estimate the number of substructure detections. For further
% analysis on substurcture population, mass function etc., it is always
% important to rule out other non-substructure effects.

[PERHAPS REARRANGE THE FOLLOWING INTO A CONCLUSIONS SECTION??]

In this paper we also demostrate the power of combining multiwavelength high resolution data. All the flux anomalous lensed quasars are radio loud systems and are first discovered in radio observations. Radio data provides reliable information on positions and fluxes of lensed images but often unable to detect lens galaxies. Since lens galaxies are mostly in low redshift, optical and near-infrared observations are ideal to measure the light distribution of lens gaxies and obtain prior on underlying mass distribution. In the previous paper of SHARP, \citet{SHARP12} show that high resolution IR imaging can help to improve lens modelling. The improvement is even more dramatic in B1555+375. With HST and SHARP AO high resolution imaging, we detect an edge-on disk which does not appear in any previous discussions on B1555+375. This new discovered edge-on disk provides a strong prior for our lens modelling and we show that it adequately explain sthe flux ratio anomaly in B1555+375. Our results demostrate that lack of knowledge of lens galaxies can lead to improper lens models. Modelling with only four image positions from radio data can also cause a lot of degeneracy. With the first system analyzing and finding an edge-on disk originated flux ratio anomaly, our follow up will be explore other similar SHARP systems. In Figure 3, all of these systems have a recognizable edge-on disk in infrared imaging. An edge-on disk structure may also be able to expalin the flux ratio anomalies of these systems.
 
%From the successful modelling of B1555+375,  we expect more flux anomalous systems requiring complex lens models (e.g. include an exponential disk), rather than just assuming smooth potential. Although the number of radio loud flux anomalous lensed quasars remains small, a new technique using narrow-line emissions will enlarge the sample and bring statistical perspective on substructures in the near future \citep{N14}. If the non-substructure effect from edge-on disks does not included, expected ``false'' substructure detections can serverly bias the data analysis. Even with real substructures presence, the lens galaxy structure can still dominate flux anomalous phenomena. For precise measurements on substurcture population, mass function, and any derived properties from strongly lensed flux anomalous systems, it is crucial to have careful estimation on non-substructure effects. We would like to draw attention to this edge-on disk orginated flux anomalies due to its impacts on substructure searching.
