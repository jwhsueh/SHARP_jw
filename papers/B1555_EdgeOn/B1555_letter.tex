\begin{abstract}
With the latest infrared image of B1555+375, an edge-on disk is shown to over cross the strong lensed images. Indicating the flux ratio anomalie of B1555+375 is dominanted by its edge-on disk structure. We present a lens model with SIE bulge and exponential disk, base on the radio observation from \citet{Marlow}. And apply this model to SHARP infrared image.

\section{Introduction}

A common feature of simulations of structure formation is the presence
of thousands of subhaloes that are associated with larger mass haloes.
However, observations of the Local Group find many fewer satellite
galaxies than are predicted by the simulations, even when taking into
account completeness corrections arising from the limited sky coverage
imposed by the Galactic Plane.  This is the famous ``missing
satellite'' problem \citep{Klypin1999, Moore1999, S07}.  In order to understand
this discrepancy, it is imperative to build up a large sample of satellites /
subhalos in galaxies outside the Local Group.  This process is challenging
due to the faintness of the satellite galaxies.  Furthermore, lower-mass
satellites may not be able to retain the gas needed for ongoing star
formation \citep[e.g.,][]{P11}, rendering them effectively dark.
These
factors make gravitational effects be powerful and promising tools in
the substructure searching.


	Flux ratio anomalies are seen in strong lensing systems which have multiple images that are spacially close to each other. These ``merging doubles'' share the same surface brightness in principle but happend to have different surface brightness. Little perturbation in gravitational potential is sufficent to bring flux ratio anomalies in strong lensed systems. This makes flux ratio anomaly becomes a promising tool to detect dark matter substructures \citep{Dalal2002, N13}. In radio band, lensing images are not sensitive to micro lensing from stars, and one can also avoid severe dust extinction issue like in optical or infrared band. However, only small number of flux ratio anomalous systems in radio are avaliable for analysis. Besides waiting for future large-scale survey such as LSST to find thousands of more new lens galaxies, another approach using narrow-line quasar emission \citep{N14} is capable to seek out more flux ratio anomalous systems for substructure analysis. 
	
	With expected growth in the number of samples, several groups have developed the technique to estimate the properties of substructures from flux ratio anomalous systems. \citet{V09, H13} both analyze the strong lens imaging to detect substructures lie infront of Einstein ring. Their methods improve the detectable mass limit and also show that high spatial resolution imaging is essential for the substructure study. On the other hand, numerical simulations on structure formation do not reach the concise conclusion on flux ratio anomalous systems. The latest study on the cause of flux anomalies from \citet{Xu14} shows the low probability of the existence of substructures in their studied systems. 
	
	The Strong lensing at High Angular Resolution Program(SHARP) is a project aims on known quadruple and Einstein ring lensing systems \citep{SHARP12}. We obtain high-resoltion images from Keck adaptive optics(AO) and Hubble Space Telescope(HST) observations. To better understand the cause of flux ratio anomaly in strong lensing systems, we model B1555+375, one of the systems discussed in \citet{Xu14}, with the new information obtained from the latest SHARP infrared imaging. We present the latest SHARP data in part 2, lens model of B1555+375 in part 3, and discussion in part 4. 

\section{Data Collection \& Reduction}

\section{Lens Modeling}
To model B1555+375, we use the lens modeling code {\tt glafic}
\citep{Oguri}.  The inputs to the model are the observed image positions
and flux densities measured by the radio observations of \citet{Marlow}.
These authors present a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) model that
provides the first fit to the image positions but
does not reproduce the strong flux ratio anomaly between components A and B.
(see Fig.6, Table 2 \& 3 in \citet{Marlow}). In K-band
image (Fig. 1, left), a recognizable edge-on disk is lie in the center
with position angle $~10$ degree. With this information, we model
B1555+375 with two models. The first model consists of an SIE bulge
and an exponential edge-on disk (SIE+Expdisk). The second model
consists of two SIE mass profiles (2-SIE), for bulge and disk
respectively. We assume that the lens galaxy has $z_{l}=0.5$ and the source has $z_s=1.5$. The full best-fit parameters are shown in Table 1. Both
of these models predict fairly matched results with the radio
observation. The comparison of observation and SIE+Expdisk result is
in Figure 2, Table 2 \& 3.

We then use an extended source to model SHARP infrared image. In Figure 1, B and D have no detection in K-band, which believed due to strong dust extinction from the edge-on disk. The region and orientation of exponential disk in lens model are consistent with this hypothesis. The flux ratios in infrared are much higher than in radio also supports as an evidence of dust extinction.

\section{Discussion}
We present new lens models of B1555+375 with a bulge and an edge-on disk. Our models better match to the radio image positions than in \citet{Marlow} and also explain the flux ratio anomaly between components A and B. In our modeling, substructure is not neccessary to exist to cause the observed flux ratio anomaly. This indicates the flux ratio anomaly in B1555+375 is resulted from the structure of lens galaxy itself, which is the edge-on disk seen in the SHARP infrared imaging. Our result is consistent with the conclusion from  \citet{Xu14}. Their simulation gives a low probability on the hypothesis that substructure causing flux anomaly in B1555+375.

With our discover in B155+375, we show that the lens galaxy structure can dominate the flux ratio anomalous phenomenon in strong lensing system. This leads to a more general reminder. Not all of the flux anomalies indicate the existence of substructures. One must fully consider non-substructure effects before gathering any statistics or serious analysis. Otherwise, these ``false'' substructures that detected by flux anomalies can serverly biased the data and analysis. For the flux ratio anomalies caused by real dark matter substructures and dwarf galaxies, non-stucture effects would also influence the estimated mass and other derived properties. Thus, we would like to draw some attention on these non-substructure effects. Once we understand more about their role in flux anomalous phenomenon, we can be more confident on searching unseen dwarf galaxies and dark matter substructures by searching flux ratio anomalous systems.

Our result also shows that multi-wavelength image is helpful on exploring flux ratio anomalous systems. The radio and narrow band observations are the best approaches to obtain accurate flux ratio data. However, optical and infrared imaging can provide more information on the structure of lens galaxy, which is also an important part in analyzing flux anomalous systems since we've shown that an edge-on disk can cause flux ratio anomaly. Our follow up will be explore more flux anomalous SHARP systems that we also notice a recognizable edge-on disk in the infrared imaging. As shown in Figure 3, the flux ratio anomalies of these systems may also able to be explained by an edge-on disk structure.\\
