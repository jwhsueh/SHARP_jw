REFEREE: In the title please change:
A flux ratio anomaly from an edge-on disc
to
A flux ratio anomaly from an edge-on disc in B1555+375

RESPONSE: The title has changed as the referee suggested.

REFEREE: In figure 2, please add a line representing the disk mid plane, and mark the disk center, and the SIE center.

RESPONSE: We have added the line representing the disk mid plane in the lens model panel and also marked the disk center and SIE center separately.

REFEREE: Is R_s is the scale length of the disc, or its scale height?  Keeton 2001 Table 1 has scale height, but the present authors refer to a scale length. There is a difference!

RESPONSE: Referring to the mass model catalog by Keeton 2001:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0102341v2.pdf
Equation (73) describes the projected surface mass density of an exponential disk. The R_d, which is the R_s in our paper, represents scale length, rather than scale height. You can see this from the definition of the model since putting an inclination angle of 90 degrees (i.i., an edge-on disk) into the model makes the surface mass density go to infinity. Thus, this model is for an infinitesimally thin disk, with a scale height of zero.
